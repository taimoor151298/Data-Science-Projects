<h2> Project 1 - Airline Flights Performance using Dash and Plotly </h2>

The project involves creating an interactive dashboard using Dash to report yearly US domestic airline flights performance for 2005-2020. Goal is to analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve flight reliability thereby improving customer reliability.

Below are the key report items,

- Yearly airline performance report 
- Yearly average flight delay statistics


In case of yearly airline performance report for a chosen year, following graphs have been plotted:

- Number of flights under different cancellation categories using bar chart.
- Average flight time by reporting airline using line chart.
- Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline using pie chart.
- Number of flights flying from each state using choropleth map.
- Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline using treemap chart.
- Yearly average flight delay statistics

For yearly average flight delay statistics, following graphs have been plotted:

- Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average national air system delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average security delay by reporting airline for the given year.
- Monthly average late aircraft delay by reporting airline for the given year.
