<h2> Project 1 - SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction </h2>


<h3> Summary </h3>
In this project, we predict whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will land or not using historical data such as payload mass, booster version, launch site and targetted orbit.

<h3> Methodology </h3>
The project involves the following steps:


**1. Data Collection**
- Using `GET` requests to the SpaceX Rest API
- Web Scraping using `beautiful soup` library

**2. Data Wrangling**
Pandas library is used to check for missing and null values. The missing values are replaced by the mean of the column.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Using Plotly Dashboards and Folium maps to understand relationship between input features and visualizing them using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries
- Using SQL to query data to explore the data set

**4. Predictive Analysis**
- Implementing SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and KNN classifiers using `sklearn` 
- Comparing the results using accuracy and confusion matrix
